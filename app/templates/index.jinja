                <p>
                    On XX March 2013, 14 year old Ayden Olson took his own
                    life. He&#39;d been bullied to death. Tragically,
                    Ayden&#39;s name is only the latest to be added to a
                    growing list. But while the victims themselves may have
                    found peace, their families are left behind, scarred
                    forever by the agony of losing a child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ayden&#39;s Law is a campaign on behalf of all those young
                    people, their families and any child or young person being
                    bullied today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BeatBullying, The Sun, and families of children like Ayden
                    are calling on David Cameron to take action. We want the
                    Prime Minister to call a summit to discuss how we can
                    prevent any more tragedies &mdash; and the creation of
                    Ayden&#39;s Law, a new children's anti-bullying bill
                    designed to stop bullying in our society once and for all.

                        Under Ayden&#39;s Law, corporate neglect would become a
                        new criminal offence, meaning schools, colleges, social
                        media, and providers of children&#39;s services would
                        be legally accountable for failures in child safety.
                        Like Corporate Manslaughter, an organisation would only
                        be guilty of this offence if the way they went about
                        their work was seen to play a major role in the safety
                        failure.

                    <p>
                        Under Ayden&#39;s Law, bullying and intimidation would
                        be a criminal offence for the first time. If a child
                        was found to be acting in a way that could cause
                        physical or mental harm to another person, they could
                        be charged and prosecuted.  Sentencing would focus on
                        out-of-court measures.

                    <p>
                        Under Ayden&#39;s Law, all social workers would be
                        given anti-bullying training as part of their social
                        work qualification. This will give them the skills and
                        confidence they need to work with their community to
                        prevent bullying, provide support for victims of
                        bullying and their families, and work with bullies to
                        address their behaviour.

                        Under Ayden&#39;s Law, all families with a child that
                        persistently bullies and intimidates others would have
                        to take part in a compulsory family intervention
                        programme.
